Netless workshop Athens 2013 Animated
=====================================
Application was created in Java Processing and visualizes the GPS position captured by smart phones together with metadata exchanged by the portable WiFi device TP-Link MR3020.

The experiment shows how information can spread only using a system that allows data exchange between users being in certain a distance. Users performed a random walk carrying a unique message to their devices. During their walk and when the WiFi device could detect other users, their devices exchanged messages. When users returned at their starting point their device's messages had analysied. Most of the participants had received most of the messages from the others even if they have met with all people. Experiment impressively shows the easy of data spreading.

It was created in the context of the "Netless" Workshop which took place at Frown with Danja Vasiliev as part of the Hybrid Cities Conference 2013 events.
